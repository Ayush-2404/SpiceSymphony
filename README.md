# **SpiceSymphony**

The Spice Symphony project is a simple restaurant website created as a starting point in web development, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the basic structure of the website, featuring key elements like a 'navigation bar', an 'about page', and a 'menu page'.

CSS is used to style the website, introducing a basic restaurant-themed design with custom colors, fonts, and layouts. The project demonstrates the styling of navigation menus, buttons, and backgrounds to enhance visual appeal. While the design is minimalistic, it serves to explore fundamental concepts of creating aesthetically pleasing and responsive web pages.

JavaScript is applied to add basic interactivity, such as handling button clicks, offering a glimpse into how dynamic features can improve user engagement.

Although Spice Symphony is not a fully functional website, it represents a significant first step in the journey of web development. This project showcases how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be combined to build a simple, interactive web page, providing a foundation for more complex projects in the future.
